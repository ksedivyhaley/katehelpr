Description: This package can be used to analyse any data in which observations are
   described by a primary and secondary categorical variable, and a numeric 
   measurement or "response". Within groups defined by the secondary variable, 
   it compares observations with different primary variables to a reference group. 
   For example, the package could be used to compare mouse weights (response) when 
   mice are fed different diets (secondary variable), comparing mutant mice to wild 
   type (primary variable with reference level).
