Description: This package provides functions for my PhD research on
    macrophage alternate activation ("polarization"). In some experiments,
    a polarizing prestimulation is followed by a secondary stimulation, and
    the effect of polarization on response to the secondary stimulation is
    of interest. The package defines functions to tidy data from my usual 
    human-friendly format, perform statistical analysis determining 
    statistical significance of changes in response compared to a control 
    polarization, and make a bar plot including these statistical summaries.
